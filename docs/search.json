The current project I am working on is determining the efficacy of utilizing an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol in pediatric patients who have undergone detethering surgery to correct TCS. The secondary objective of this study is to see whether implementing a standardized ERAS protocol for patients who undergo detethering helps to mitigate post-operative opiate consumption."

    "text": "4.1 The Question\nTo find a good proxy for liver damage, I decided to compares the means of two quantitative variables from the NHANES 2017-2020 dataset. There were 7247 NHANES participants with complete ALT values and 7216 NHANES participants with complete AST values.\nQuestion: Since both elevated ALT and AST are indicators of liver damage and since these variables are collected on each of the participants and can be considered paired samples, do the means of these two enzymmatic markers of liver function closely approximate each other, such that they are not significantly different?\nExpectation: Both ALT and AST are functionally related enzymmatic markers, even though elevated ALT is more characteristic of liver damage. In this case, I expect there to be no significant difference between the means of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase values. If there is no significant difference, this would indicate that either of these variables could be used as a proxy for liver damage in future analysis."

    "text": "4.2 Describing the Data\n\n4.2.1 Variables\nThe variable lbxsatsi is the alanine aminotransferase (ALT; in U/L) level measured in the blood serum of the NHANES participants. The ALT level was recorded in units/liter. This enzyme is specific to the liver and and elevated serum ALT is an indicator of liver damage.\nThe variable lbxsassi is the aspartate aminotransferase (AST; in U/L) level measured in the blood serum of the NHANES participants. The AST was also recorded in units/liter. This enzyme is present in the liver, heart, brain, kidneys, and muscles, but is classically used as a less-specific marker of liver damage.\n\n\n4.2.2 Numerical Summaries/Visualizations\n\n4.2.2.1 Visualization\nFirst, the data was visualized to observe whether there appeared to be an association between ALT and AST. The dataset was filtered to the complete cases that had recorded ALT and AST values for this analysis.\n\nliver_damage_analA &lt;- liver_damage %&gt;%\n  filter(complete.cases(lbxsatsi, lbxsassi))\n\nliver_damage_analA %&gt;%\n  ggplot(., aes(x = lbxsatsi, y = lbxsassi)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", col = \"red\",\n              se = TRUE, formula = y ~ x) +\n  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) +\n  labs(caption = \"Each subject had an ALT (in U/L) and AST (in U/L)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince ALT and AST are paired by participant, we can calculate an additional variable, the difference between ALT and AST values to make a visual comparison of the difference between the two values more apparent.

I think this may be due to the concept that I mentioned earlier that ALT is a more specific indicator of liver damage, and would be more likely to be elevated in a population, compared to AST. Further investigation with these two variables could look into whether there is a correlation between these liver enzymes and history of alcohol use in this NHANES population."

    "text": "7.4 Conclusions\nThe results of the Chi-squared test above result in a p-value that is much less than 0.05. Since there are more than five observations in each cell, I conclude that the Chi-squared test is an appropriate statistic to assess the possible association between Race/Hispanic Origin and Period of High Alcohol Consumption. Given that the p-value is 1.5x10-6 and is much less than 0.05, I conclude that I can reject the null hypothesis, that there is no association between Race/Hispanic Origin and Period of High Alcohol Consumption. This test statistic indicates that there is a significant association between these two variables. The Chi-squared statistic is also quite large compared to the Chi-square value needed to achieve significant at p &lt; 0.05 with 4 degrees of freedom (X2 = 9.49), thus reinforcing our conclusion that there is a strong association between Race/Hispanic Origin and Period of High Alcohol Consumption. However, there would have to be further analysis to determine the nature of this association and define whether there are specific Race/Hispanic Origin groups that have higher rates of a Period of High Alcohol Consumption."

I am in Dr. Lilyana Angelov’s research group at the Cleveland Clinic Brain Tumor and Neuro-Oncology Center.\nMy hometown is Hastings, Nebraska, a small city in the mid-western part of the state. I completed my undergraduate education at Washington University in St. Louis. While in St. Louis, I worked as a student researcher at St. Louis Children’s Hospital in hematology/oncology. In Dr. Melanie Fields’s lab, I did research on the cognitive impacts of sickle cell disease (SCD) and used MRI to quantify the structural and functional affect of SCD on the brain.\nCurrently, my research interests are focused in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS/gamma knife surgery). I have recently joined the Angelov lab and am in the process of defining my own project to explore surgical outcomes of SRS for brain and spine tumors.\nAs a medical student, I am involved in student leadership through the Student Committee on Medical Education (SCME). I am the student representative for Block 6: Cognition, Sensation, and Movement, which covers Neurology and the Behavioral Sciences. In this role, I convey student feedback to administrators and act as the student representative on the curricular design team for Block 6.\nOn my website, you can find my published scholarly articles and papers as well as descriptions of the current projects I am working on in research. Please feel free to contact me if you have questions or thoughts."
