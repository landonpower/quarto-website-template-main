# Welcome to my website!

I am Landon Power, a medical student and researcher at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. I am in Dr. Lilyana Angelov's research group at the Cleveland Clinic Brain Tumor and Neuro-Oncology Center.

My hometown is Hastings, Nebraska, a small city in the mid-western part of the state. I completed my undergraduate education at Washington University in St. Louis. While in St. Louis, I worked as a student researcher at St. Louis Children's Hospital in hematology/oncology. In Dr. Melanie Fields's lab, I did research on the cognitive impacts of sickle cell disease (SCD) and used MRI to quantify the structural and functional affect of SCD on the brain.

Currently, my research interests are focused in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS/gamma knife surgery). I have recently joined the Angelov lab and am in the process of defining my own project to explore surgical outcomes of SRS for brain and spine tumors. 

As a medical student, I am involved in student leadership through the Student Committee on Medical Education (SCME). I am the student representative for Block 6: Cognition, Sensation, and Movement, which covers Neurology and the Behavioral Sciences. In this role, I convey student feedback to administrators and act as the student representative on the curricular design team for Block 6.

On my website, you can find my published scholarly articles and papers as well as descriptions of the current projects I am working on in research. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:lcp68@case.edu) if you have questions or thoughts.
